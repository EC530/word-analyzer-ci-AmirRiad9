This is a code to read words in a document, return the word count and each word frequency. The program creates a histogram with the word frequency and includes the number of words in the text file.

For testing purposes, change filename in main.py to the .txt file you want to test and unit tests will run on functions accordingly. 

Here is the Histogram displayed using text1.txt
